# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-Using-GAN

Then main obective of this project is to solve the challenge of enhancing low-light images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The study primarily focuses on improving the performance of GAN-based low light image enhancement models through hyperparameter tuning and advanced image preprocessing techniques.

Dataset : 

The work in this research is conducted using the publicly accessible LOL dataset, which consists of 500 image pairs with low and normal light divided into 485 training pairs and 15 testing pairs.Every image in the dataset has a resolution of 400 x 600.
