# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-Using-GAN
My masters degree thesis project

Then main obective of this project is to solve the challenge of enhancing low-light images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The study primarily focuses on improving the performance of GAN-based low light image enhancement models through hyperparameter tuning and advanced image preprocessing techniques.

Dataset : 

In this project the openly available LOL dataset, which comprises 500 low-light and normal-light image pairs split into 485 training pairs and 15 testing pairs, will be used.
